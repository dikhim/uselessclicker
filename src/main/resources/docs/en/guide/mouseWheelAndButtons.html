</head>
<body>
To work with the mouse buttons and the wheel there is a built-in "mouse" object. Methods for working with buttons are similar to methods for working with keyboard keys(press, release, button, click). Look at the code below.
<div class="codebox">
    <pre><code>mouse.press('LEFT');
mouse.release('LEFT');
        
mouse.button('RIGHT','PRESS');
mouse.button('RIGHT','RELEASE');

mouse.click('MIDDLE');
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Also, the "mouse" object has methods for working with the scroll wheel. To control the mouse wheel, you must specify two parameters: the direction of scrolling <strong> "UP / DOWN" </strong> and the numeric parameter the number of lines.
</p>
<div class="codebox">
    <pre><code>mouse.wheel('DOWN',3);
mouse.wheel('UP',3);
</code></pre>
</div>
